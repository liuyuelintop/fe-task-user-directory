# User Directory Speed Build

> **Audience:** Interview prep, solo practice  
> **Time:** 35–60 minutes  
> **Prereqs:** Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, React Query basics

Move through the build in discrete phases so you can practice, pause, or revisit specific steps without scrolling a 1,000-line doc.

## Phases

1. [Setup (0–5 min)](01-setup.md) — scaffold the project and wire React Query.
2. [Data Layer (5–15 min)](02-data-layer.md) — define types and stabilize the fetch pipeline.
3. [Working UI (15–35 min)](03-ui-build.md) — ship the first end-to-end experience.
4. [Refinement (35–50 min)](04-refinement.md) — extract components, add favorites, polish.
5. [Checklists & Timeboxes](05-checklists.md) — stay on schedule and review success criteria.
6. [Next Steps](06-next-steps.md) — drills, retros, and variations to lock in the workflow.

## Timeline Overview

- **0–5 min:** Project setup  
- **5–15 min:** Types + data layer  
- **15–35 min:** Working UI (single component)  
- **35 min:** Stop and test  
- **35–50 min:** Refine (favorites, extraction)

Each phase file ends with “handoff” links into troubleshooting, reference, and interview docs so you can branch into deeper notes when needed.
