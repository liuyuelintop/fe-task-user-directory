# Next Steps & Practice Loops

> **Audience:** Post-tutorial practice  
> **Time:** Flexible  
> **Prereqs:** Completed at least one full run-through

Lock the workflow into muscle memory and expand the project where it matters.

## Repeat Without Notes

1. Delete the project and rebuild from memory.  
2. Track how long each phase takes; aim for 35 minutes to core completion.  
3. Write down anything you forget and plug it back into your checklist.

## Practice Loop

- **Round 1:** Core data + basic list.  
- **Round 2:** Filters (search + nationality).  
- **Round 3:** Extract `UserCard`.  
- **Round 4:** Favorites tab + intersection count.  
- **Round 5:** UX polish (empty states, clear filters).  
- **Round 6:** Performance/clarity (memos, minimal re-renders).  
- **Round 7:** Accessibility pass (labels, roles).

## Stretch Goals

- Add runtime validation with `zod`.  
- Extract Search/Nationality inputs into controlled components.  
- Build a `useUserFilter` hook to encapsulate memo logic.  
- Improve error handling and retry strategies.  
- Add accessibility enhancements (labels, keyboard navigation).

## Variations

- Swap the API for a different dataset.  
- Introduce additional filters (age, gender, favorites first).  
- Recreate the UI without Tailwind to test your CSS fundamentals.

## Keep Communicating

- Record yourself narrating the build; refine explanations.  
- Revisit [Interview Playbooks](../interview/index.md) to tailor the story for different levels.
